# DemoApp

Spring Boot DemoApp makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## 1. How to start
```
$ git clone https://github.com/crkarthik11/DemoApp.git
$ cd demoApp
$ mvnw spring-boot:run

$ curl -v localhost:8080
```
